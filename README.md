# BDM-Project
Business Data Management Capstone Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains my Business Data Management (BDM) capstone project completed as part of the IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications program.
The project focuses on analysing customer credit behaviour and receivables risk using real-world invoice-level data, with the objective of understanding delayed payments, working capital blockage, and liquidity pressure.
## Problem Statement

The core business problem addressed in this project is inefficient credit management, leading to delayed customer payments and constrained cash flow despite healthy sales performance.

 ## Methodology & Tools

+ The analysis applies the following data management and analytical techniques:

+ Data Cleaning & Standardisation of invoice-level transactional data

+ DSO Proxy & Ageing Analysis to estimate payment delays

+ RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis for customer segmentation

+ ABC Analysis to assess product-level revenue and credit concentration

+ Decision Tree–Based Credit Risk Classification to identify high-risk invoices

+ Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualisation using Python

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

## Key Findings

+ A significant portion of invoice value remains unpaid at any given time, creating liquidity pressure

+ Receivables are highly concentrated among a small group of builder-category customers

+ A single product category dominates both revenue and outstanding dues, indicating concentration risk

+ Credit risk is primarily driven by unpaid proportion and invoice ageing rather than customer relationships
## Recommendations

+ Based on the analysis, the project proposes:

+ Segmented, behaviour-based credit policies

+ Clear credit thresholds and early risk flags

+ Product-specific credit controls for high-risk items

+ Simple digital monitoring of receivables and ageing
